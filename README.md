# odin_rock_paper_scissors
A JavaScript project from The Odin Project, applying concepts learned from the JavaScript basic course.

I finished this project almost 3 months ago that was May of 2025. I took a summer break and now (August 2025), I made some changes, fixed some errors and I believe it's now complete.

This project is supposed to be a simple one, I decided to go the extra mile to explore and learn more along the way. I’m proud of the progress I’ve made and excited to finally share this project.
